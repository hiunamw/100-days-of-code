Head over to [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/index_en.html) and select **Hurdle** challenges to practice while loops.

After that, complete the **Maze** challenge. (Note: You will face an intermediate debugging problem at some point. Once it happens, it's better to complete Day 7-15 first if your are a beginner.)
